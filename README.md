### Matrix

---

This originally started as an experiment, I just wanted to play around with vanilla JS graphics.
Now it turned into an actual project, with multiple types. <br />

* The Standalone: <br />
    The Standalone type is basically what you find [here](https://felixvogel.github.io/Matrix)
    
* The Embedded: <br />
    The Embedded type can be added to any website, find out more [here](https://github.com/FelixVogel/Matrix/wiki/Embedding-Matrix)

* Wallpaper Engine: <br />
    The Wallpaper Engine version is available [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2009434928)

It also now comes with the feature that you can add your own custom FX! Read more [here](https://github.com/FelixVogel/Matrix/wiki/Creating-Custom-FX) if you are interested!
